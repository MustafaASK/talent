                            <p>After hearing about the professional roadblocks so many face, our CEO Manish Karani 
                                had a vision to create a safe space for everyone who needs it; a virtual portal powered 
                                by ASK Consulting with access to expert resources including upskilling and reskilling tools, 
                                resume writing workshops, a personal job concierge and more. We’re a guide for both those 
                                looking for work and those looking to hire talented individuals for their organization. </p>
