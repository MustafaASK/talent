                            <p>We live in unprecedented times, and the cybersecurity landscape is no exception.  
                            </p>
                            <p>A month doesn’t go by without national news of a cyberattack. Global businesses, 
                                federal government agencies, financial institutions and consumers daily fall victim 
                                to cyberwarfare, putting private data and information at risk.
                            </p>
                            <p>And matters appear to be worsening as breaches rise in numbers. Since the onset of 
                                the COVID-19 pandemic, the FBI reported a <a href='https://www.imcgrupo.com/covid-19-news-fbi-reports-300-increase-in-reported-cybercrimes/'> <strong>300% increase in cybercrimes</strong> </a> as employers 
                                transitioned to a remote workforce. This continued criminal activity is also poised 
                                to cause <a href='https://cybersecurityventures.com/hackerpocalypse-cybercrime-report-2016/'> <strong>$10.5 trillion in damages</strong> </a> to the global economy by 2025. 
                            </p>
                            <p>Sadly, the rise in incidents and costs exacerbates a pre-existing dilemma—a widening 
                                talent gap. There are currently <a href='https://www.cyberseek.org/heatmap.html?utm_campaign=wp_the_cybersecurity_202&utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&wpisrc=nl_cybersecurity202'> <strong>464,420 unfilled cybersecurity roles</strong> </a> in the U.S. today.</p>

                            <p>There’s an undeniable race to secure talent. With such a vast supply and demand 
                                disparity, organizations need to think outside the box when maintaining a cybersecurity 
                                team in 2022. </p>
                            <p>Understanding the motivations of cybersecurity professionals and developing a strategy to 
                                attract and retain employees are critical to building a successful talent pipeline. 
                                Here are five areas employers should focus on to improve their talent management strategy:

                            <p>Attitude and aptitude can go a long way when recruiting candidates for cybersecurity roles. Employers need to look 
                                beyond the resume and prioritize traits that make a cybersecurity team successful. </p>
                            <p>Top cybersecurity professionals are critical thinkers, problem-solvers, creators and team players. These existing
                                 professionals are life-long learners who seek to make an impact through their work.</p>
                            <p>Employers serious about attracting and retaining cybersecurity talent should work directly with their HR partners 
                                to build a talent management strategy that identifies and develops the skills needed to maintain a candidate pipeline

                            <p>In a world with a shallow technical talent pool, organizations must commit to 
                                finding the right people and providing upskilling. Doing so will foster internal talent, 
                                reduce turnover and increase employee engagement—key factors that build a resilient cybersecurity

                            <p>In a widening talent gap, it’s essential that hiring teams broaden their talent pools. 
                                The bigger the talent net, the more candidates you can identify.
                            </p>
                            <p>One top way to do so is to consider non-traditional candidates. These include career 
                                transitioners, former military personnel and law enforcement. In fact, veterans and 
                                former law enforcement are a growing demographic within the cybersecurity field. 
                            </p>
                            <p><a href='https://www.isc2.org/-/media/ISC2/Research/2021/CybersecurityCareerPursuers-Study'> <strong>Recent studies</strong> </a> report that 31% of current cybersecurity professionals have either military

                                field because of their innate ability to problem-solve. And 49% of these people feel that 
                                cybersecurity embraces their skill sets and interests.</p>
                            <p>Employers also find the qualities in veterans—discipline, dedication and teamwork—a commodity 
                                for working in cybersecurity. Moreover, many military forces currently use some of the most 
                                advanced technology in existence today.

                            <p>Sometimes, the best talent is hiding right under your nose. Employers looking for creative ways to 
                                attract and retain cybersecurity professionals should strongly consider the talent already enlisted 
                                within their IT organization. 
                            </p>
                            <p>In today’s competitive landscape, most of the current cybersecurity workforce has previously worked in IT
                                 roles. In fact, nearly 55% of cybersecurity professionals have transitioned from IT, according to a recent <a href='https://www.isc2.org/-/media/ISC2/Research/2021/CybersecurityCareerPursuers-Study'> <strong>ISC2 report</strong> </a>.
                            </p>
                            <p>There is an undeniable growing need among candidates in this field to tackle new problems, elevate their careers and 
                                continually learn. Employers should embrace this fact and implement hiring for potential. 
                            </p>
                            <p>While an IT background can gauge a candidate’s ability to be productive in a cybersecurity role, it isn’t always a 
                                prerequisite. More than <a href='https://www.isc2.org/-/media/ISC2/Research/2021/CybersecurityCareerPursuers-Study'> <strong>25% of cybersecurity professionals</strong> </a> have less than three years of experience started in fields other than IT.
                            </p>
                            <p>Now more than ever, it’s essential to hire outside the box. Talent also exists internally outside your IT organization. 
                                Tapping into internal talent gives employers the upper hand to hire individuals already familiar with company systems, processes and culture.</p>
                            <p>When assessing internal candidates, prioritize skills critical to executing cybersecurity protocols such as critical thinking, analysis, 
                                problem-solving, collaboration and resourcefulness. Companies can also develop internal shadow programs to encourage new cybersecurity talent.</p>

                                business and digital landscape. To effectively secure data and digital assets, organizations need to develop 
                                internal cybersecurity education programs at an enterprise level and for cybersecurity professionals themselves.
