                            <p>Looking for a job can be undeniably lonely. 
                            </p>
                            <p>Whether you currently have a job and have to keep your job search hush hush from a current employer 
                               or jobless, The important thing is how you choose to soften the mental impact:
                            </p>
                            <p><strong>Recognize the signs of loneliness.</strong> Are you sleeping badly, 
                                binge-watching TV shows, doom scrolling social media, feeling run down and feeling down? All these can stem 
                                from loneliness and a lack of social connection. This cycle won’t be broken until you acknowledge that it’s happening.
                            </p>
                            <p><strong>Educate yourself on loneliness and mental health.</strong> 
                                When you brush an issue such as loneliness under the carpet, it doesn’t go anywhere, 
                                only to reappear when you are feeling down. Educating yourself on loneliness from your doctor
                                 and/or mental health experts informs you about the realness of what’s happening to you and how 
                                 to seek help.
                            </p>
                            <p><strong>Consider sharing your feelings.</strong> 
                                 Whether you are talking with a friend or confiding in a therapist,
                                 sharing how you feel is always encouraged. It is all too easy to slip into negative thought patterns
                                  – waiting for those interview invites to arrive is a lonely place. Sharing your concerns and life events
                                   with others can be both motivating and offer you support during a tough time.
                            </p>
                            <p><strong>Volunteer with a cause or club.</strong> 
                                 Sometimes it helps to get your mind off the job search. Volunteer for a
                                 cause and meet like-minded people, meet up with a friend for coffee, have dinner with family or engage in a favorite hobby. 
                            </p>
                            <p><strong>Connect with nature every day.</strong> 
                                 There is nothing better than feeling like you are part of something more. 
                                Venturing outdoors is an inspired way to relax – watching nature do her thing makes you realize that there 
                                is always a plan. You might not be certain about your future role, but you can be sure that you will be making a difference.
                            </p>
                            <p><strong>Don’t compare yourself to others.</strong> 
                                 When you don’t have a job or aren’t feeling satisfied in your current role, 
                                it can feel isolating when you see other people doing something they love. Practice self-compassion and remind 
                                yourself that everyone’s journey is different. Your time will come.
                            </p>
                            <p> 
                                Loneliness can feel debilitating during a tough job search, but if you view it as a journey, then you can choose to 
                                search for ways to escape the void, rediscover your self-confidence and eventually find a job that will help you to 
                                feel satisfied and happy to go to work every day.
                            </p>
