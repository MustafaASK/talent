                            <p>The cybersecurity field continues to grow each year, and the job marketplace remains highly competitive. 
                            </p>
                            <p>The cybersecurity sector is expected to <a href='https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/information-security-analysts.htm'> <strong>increase by 33% before 2030</strong> </a>, a rate exceeding the average 
                                for all occupations, according to the Bureau of Labor and Statistics. And sadly, only <a href='https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2018/08/09/the-cybersecurity-talent-gap-is-an-industry-crisis/?sh=1018cc64a6b3'> <strong>14% of IT security managers</strong> </a> feel there are enough quality cybersecurity professionals with the right skills 
                                to respond to threats.
                            </p>
                            <p>To effectively stand out and land a role, job candidates need to tell an effective, compelling 
                                story that details how they uniquely manage cybersecurity threats for employees. 
                            </p>
                            <p>Here are three often-overlooked resume hacks that will confidently show a company you’re the 
                                right candidate to defend their tech and data infrastructure. </p>
                            <div class="image-row mt-3 mb-3">
                                <div class="img-container">

                            <p>Ah, the dreaded cover letter. Writing one for a job application is tedious. And many job 
                                seekers find them pointless alongside a resume.
                            </p>
                            <p>Yet, nearly <a href='https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1080569909334015'> <strong>56 percent of employers</strong> </a> want applicants to submit a cover letter with their 
                                application. While seemingly redundant, if a job you’re applying for requests one or gives 
                                you the option to include a cover letter — write a strong, compelling one.</p>
                            <p>A cover letter may be your one opportunity to stand out from others, especially if it’s optional. 
                                Nonetheless, it’s a great chance to showcase what you uniquely bring to a position that can’t be fully illustrated in your resume.
                            </p>
                            <p>The cover letter is the perfect moment to demonstrate your passion, enthusiasm and motivation for your field and desired position. 
                                You can also use a cover letter to pre-emptively answer questions a hiring manager may have when reviewing your resume, from employment 
                                gaps to career transitions.</p>
                            <p><strong>Tips for writing a cover letter</strong></p>
                            <p>Be specific and original</p>
                            <p>Use a different cover letter for each position you apply for instead of the same template. Tailor your cover letter to pertinent aspects 
                                of the job that play up your unique skills and expertise. </p>
                            <p>When writing your cover letter, consider what the position is precisely looking for and be sure to emphasize these points. Just like your resume, 
                                your cover letter should be hyper-targeted for the role you desire. </p>
                            <p>Emphasize your soft skills
                            </p>
                            <p>While hard skills are paramount to the information technology world, soft skills are often just as crucial to today’s employers. Now more than ever, 
                                companies need cybersecurity professionals who have verifiable people skills as security remains a top concern in the back office and the board room.</p>
                            <p>Communication and analytical skills are high in demand for cybersecurity roles. Whether entry or senior-level, candidates should be able to discuss 
                                and explain complex topics in an easily understandable way to internal stakeholders.</p>
                            <p>Leadership ability also ranks high on a hiring manager’s list. If you’ve led a team or project, be sure to note this. Organizations desire workers
                                 who take charge, not just execute.</p>
                            <p>Be confident and clear
                            </p>
                            <p>A cover letter isn’t the time to be shy or casual about your interest in a role. Employers should feel confident by reading your cover letter that 
                                you’re the right person for the job. Your tone and content must exemplify that you’re not just ready for the job but can accomplish whatever the role entails. </p>
                            <p>To express your confidence, be explicit about your excitement for the role. Drive center what your organizational impact has been during prior positions with 
                                statistical proof points and past achievements. Lastly, ensure that your cover letter is concise, one page long and free of grammatical errors.
                            </p>
                            <p>Hiring managers have a ton of applications to sort through. Keeping your cover letter short, memorable and coherent will not only make an excellent first impression 
                                but also increase the likelihood that your application makes it to the “yes” stack instead of “no.”</p>

                            <p>The answer—the STAR method. This popular behavioral interview response method can also be applied when perfecting your resume.

                            <p><strong>Tips for using the STAR method on a cybersecurity resume</strong></p>
                            <p>Identify 2-3 key skills to highlight 
                            </p>
                            <p>Creating a resume using the STAR method requires exemplifying behaviors that your employer desires. You can identify these by examining the job description 
                                and upstaging your matching, verifiable skills.
                            </p>
                            <p>If an employer is looking for a professional to manage a security team, play up your leadership abilities. If there’s a need for a worker that knows how to formulate and develop security protocols, lead with your process improvement skills.
                            </p>
                            <p>Your skill selection to highlight will only be impactful if it aligns with the scope of the role in question. Picking skills that are not in-demand will only help convince a hiring manager that you’re not the right pick of the litter.
                            </p>
                            <p>Outline a response to the desired skill</p>
                            <p>Create a verbal answer to showcase your experience for the coveted skill using the STAR method. For example, if a job description calls for a good communicator and collaborator, 
                                a STAR method answer may look like this:</p>
                            <p><strong>Situation -</strong> <i>“When I worked as an Info Security Director, I led the organizational goal of developing and implementing internal policies and procedures that help thwart unauthorized access, modification and destruction of data.”</i>
                            </p>
                            <p><strong>Task -</strong> <i>“After working in this position for a year, I noticed there was no enterprise education on the importance and best practices of cybersecurity.”</i>  
                            </p>
                            <p><strong>Action -</strong> <i>“As a result, I created a company-wide security test with a fake phishing email to routinely evaluate the current security posture. I also developed info security training modules with the leadership and development team for the new employee onboarding process and quarterly refresher courses to retain best practices.”</i>
                            </p>
                            <p><strong>Result -</strong> <i>“After developing an Infosecurity-driven internal culture with routine education and tech updates, our cyberattacks declined by 29%.”</i></p>
                            <p>Condense your response to bullet points
                            </p>
                            <p>Using bullet points, outline the components of the STAR response with a sentence or phrase for each point.</p>
