                            <p>While you may not have found your dream job just yet, all job seekers this holiday season should be excited that the market is now in their favor.
                            </p>
                           
                            <p>Since February 2020, the US has had <a href='https://www.wsj.com/articles/millions-of-americans-are-unemployed-despite-record-job-openings-11628587802'> <strong>more job openings than available workers</strong> </a> to take them for the first time. Employer demand for workers is incredibly high. And at the same time, the labor supply is low.
                            </p>
                            <p>Moreover, turnover is on the rise. According to the federal <a href='https://www.bls.gov/news.release/jolts.nr0.htm'> <strong>Job Openings and Labor Turnover Summary</strong> </a>, this past August, a record 4.3 million workers left positions. The job market is tightening with more quits and voluntary separations rising year-over-year. More and more employees are leaving companies in pursuit of better opportunities.
                            </p>
                            <p>While this puts a strain on businesses, job seekers are empowered now more than ever to explore their options. If you’ve been nervous about pursuing a job or career change, be encouraged that today’s talent market conditions are leaning in favor of candidates. You can now be flexible in your job selection. There’s ample choice for everyone. </p>

                            <p>Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, workers have successfully proven the same productivity in the office can be performed at home. This has also made remote work a non-negotiable for many job seekers.</p>
                            <p>While some companies have started the journey to resume functions in brick-and-mortar offices,  many businesses have remained remote or adopted a part-time remote work lifestyle as part of company culture.</p>
                            <p>Since the pandemic, Pew Research reports that <a href='https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2020/12/09/how-the-coronavirus-outbreak-has-and-hasnt-changed-the-way-americans-work/'> <strong>71% of workers are doing their job from home</strong> </a> all or most of the time.</p>
                            <p>Companies have also been more accommodating to employees who work at home by allowing special arrangements for events to address mental health, family needs, education desires, gym time and more. As a result, non-traditional work schedules are growing in popularity.
                            </p>
                            <p>If you've been dying for a more flexible work environment, now might be your time to pursue a new role. Employers are trending up for making flexible accommodations that encourage work-life balance for productive employees.
