                            <p>A text message flashes up on our phone screen: “Hey, good luck on the interview. I know you 
                                will ace it. Let me know how it goes!”

                            <p>Now imagine more messages like this from people you’ve worked with professionally in your past
                                and present, virtually or in person. These additional means of support are crucial in your job 
                                search, especially when you need references, a letter of recommendation or even a mentor or 
                                advice-giver.
                            </p>
                            <p>But they don’t just pop up out of nowhere. You need to foster these relationships regularly so 
                                it doesn’t turn people off when you really do need them. No one likes to feel used or as if 
                                they’re good for nothing more than helping you.

                            <p>Here are four ways to engage with your LinkedIn connections throughout your professional career, 
                                whether you’re searching for a job or not. 
                            </p>

                            </div>
                            <p>When you meet someone new in your professional journey, whether in person or via video call, 
                                make note of their names and connect with them on LinkedIn within one week.
                            </p>
                            <p>When you send a connection request, include a personalized note. For example:  
                            </p>
                            <p><i>Hi [insert name]! It was a pleasure meeting with you on Monday to discuss our upcoming project. 
                                I look forward to working with you.</i> 
                            </p>
                            <p>This is a great opportunity to have meaningful connections with people you’ve actually worked or interacted with.
                            </p>

                                If you have a good experience with someone you worked with on a project or volunteer opportunity, 
                                leave a Recommendation on their LinkedIn profile. When you submit it, shoot them a message and let them 
                                know how great it was working with them. This could entice them to write you one back and work great as 
                                testimonials to show potential employers during your job search. 
                            </p>

                                land a new job, get a promotion or post an update to their profile, let them know you see it.

                                enjoyed reading the article they posted. Customize your response by including their name, use a smiley 
                                face emoji or a thumbs up. Did they write a book, article or reach a major milestone? Share their post with 
                                a personalized message.
